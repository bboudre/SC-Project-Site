Freshman Student At NMSU.
	 	 	 As, a person that’s totally new to the parking situation at NMSU Campus. I would like to 
have an dedicated app that will show where I can park with my tag, open spots, and navigation to an open 
spot.
	 	 	 Elaboration: Users should have the ability to just open the app. Input there status on where 
they can park; and find where is the closest parking spot to walk there desired building on Campus.
	 	 	 Constraints: None
				

			 Effort Estimation: ~60-80 person-hours
			

		

	 	 	 Intergrated tools : Your device either iPhone or android
	 	 	 Acceptance Test: Perform the task of having the user input. The needed input, and then 
seamlessly translate to the in-app navigation to the parking spot:
	 

	 	 	 Senior Sutdent At NMSU with some development knowledge.
	 	 	 As, an student that has the NMSU parking map like the back of my hand. I would love a 
dedicated app that will show the closest parking lot with open spots. Navigation would be nice but not 
really an importance. 
	 	 	 Elaboration: User should be able to open the app. Input there need of parking lot closest to 
the building they need to go. Lastly, showing either lots with open parking spaces or actual parking spaces 
that are open.
			

	 	 	 Constraint: Amount of time allotted to development, Knowledge in using Sensors, How fast 
the app will update with new information.
	 

			 Effort Estimation: ~100-120 person-hours
			

	 	 	 Intergrated Tools: IPhone, Some type of mini computer that will take the sensor data, and 
the use of some local sever to keep all the updated info.
	 	 	 Acceptance Test: Seamless use of the app running and use. It updates at least every time 
the user requests or automatically.
	 	 	 Professor At NMSU
	 	 	 As, a faculty member there is a lot of options that are closer to the building I’m teaching / 
have my office in. The use of an official parking app for NMSU would be nice. If it had the the functionality 
of telling me the closest parking space that’s open. That has the current shortest walk to the building I want 
to go. Also, being able to update if there is any closer spaces open. To suggest me to instead go there than 
my original choice.
	 	 	 Elaboration: User will be able to open the app. Input the building they need to go to. And 
will show with parking space is closest. Also, the app should send me a notification suggesting to change 
routes if a better parking spot becomes available.
	 	 	 Constraints: the refresh rate of sending a notification to your phone. The usability of the UI. 
Lastly, how much cost for Said app?
			 Effort Estimation: ~150-200 person-hours
			

	 	 	 Intergrated Tools: the use of a microcontroller sensor combo an iPhone, and also a local 
server to seamlessly send out notifications.
	 	 	 Acceptance test: An app that runs flawlessly. An is consistent in its operation
